# Jingle-Writer
This is a game about guessing the right notes from characters 'A' to 'G'.
The main class of the code is "JingleWriterCli.java".
The way it works is that a random jingle is created that is 5 letters long so e.g "ACCBE".
The user will have to guess the notes by inputting the letters one by one in the terminal and the program will display the "History" (what the user has tried before) , the if it's in order and if it's the correct letter.

The code will iterate until the user gets it right.
