# Jingle-Writer
This game challenges you to guess the correct notes from characters 'A' to 'G'. The main class responsible for running the game is "JingleWriterCli.java".

How It Works
A random jingle consisting of 5 letters is generated, such as "ACCBE". Each letter represents a note in the game.
Your task is to guess the notes by inputting the letters one by one in the terminal.
After each guess, the program will provide you with valuable information:
History: The sequence of notes you have tried so far.
Order: Whether the notes you guessed are in the correct order.
Correct: Whether the current note you guessed is correct.
Based on this feedback, you can use your deduction skills to refine your subsequent guesses and aim for the perfect jingle!
